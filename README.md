Ansible jfrog module
==========

# Introduction
Ansible modules to interact with an artifactory instance.

# Usage

## Repository
Ensure a repository is present
```yaml
- name: Create an artifactory repo
      artifactory_repo:
        artifactory: "https://artifactory.com/artifactory/"
        user: "admin_user"
        password: "admin_user_password"
        key: "docker-local"
        packageType: "docker"
        description: "A docker repo"
      register: result
```

Ensure a repository is absent
```yaml
- name: Delete an artifactory repo
      artifactory_repo:
        artifactory: "https://artifactory.com/artifactory/"
        user: "admin_user"
        password: "admin_user_password"
        key: "docker-local"
        packageType: "docker"
        description: "A docker repo"
        state: "absent"
      register: result
```

# Development

## Debugging

For debugging the module, use the ansible `test-module` python script. First install it:
  
    git clone git://github.com/ansible/ansible.git --recursive
    
Then setup the environment to use it:

    . ./ansible/hacking/env-setup
    
Then execute the module with params, for example:

    ./ansible/hacking/test-module -m ./library/artifactory_repo.py -a "artifactory='https://artifactory.com/artifactory/' packageType=docker key='docker-local1' password='<admin_user_password>' user='<admin_user>'"
    
Without this you will not see print statements, or the underlying issue causing module failures.

## Testing

Ensure the test playbooks included here work with the module. Setup the python venv:

    virtualenv venv
    . ./venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Test the ensure absent playbook by running

    ansible-playbook playbooks/play-artifactory-repo-delete.yml

Test the ensure present playbook by running
    
    ansible-playbook playbooks/play-artifactory-repo-create.yml
    
And so on for all playbooks

Run each multiple times to ensure the module handles scenarios where the repo is already in the desired state.

# TODO

Create gitlab pipeline

Auto deploy to ansible control nodes

Automate the test runs so that they can work in the gitlab pipeline
